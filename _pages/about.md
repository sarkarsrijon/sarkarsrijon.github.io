Originally from Kolkata India, I started at Emory University fall of 2023. I'm majoring in Applied Math and Statistics with a focus on Computational Biology (protein design and oncology). I also like anything Quantum and startups!

I took a gap year before undergrad and traveled to explore various communities. I'm grateful to be a part of various communities such as [Emergent Ventures](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/08/emergent-ventures-india-cohort-five.html), SPARC, WARP, Effective Altruism, [Spirit of Ramanujan Fellowship](https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/blog/finding-todays-ramanujans-spirit-ramanujan-stem-talent-initiative), Monsoon Math, Yale YGS, etc.

Previously, I did mathematical olympiads in India, and [this](https://srijonsarkar.wordpress.com) was my old blog with content around it.

Lastly, I very much appreciate movements (dancing & grappling), movies (cinematic & biographic), and memories (experiences & lores).
