I am 19 years old and am from Kolkata. Eager about bioengineering and startups, I'm exploring Oncology from a mathematical perspective.

I took a gap year before undergrad and traveled to explore various communities. I would major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Emory University starting this fall.

Previously, I did mathematical olympiads in India, and [this](https://srijonsarkar.wordpress.com) was my old blog with content around it.
