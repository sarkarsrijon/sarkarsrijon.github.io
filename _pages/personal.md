Lately, I've been having some really interesting conversations! Specifically, I've been chatting with people and organizations about supporting early career researchers, fostering math communities, and exploring <a href='https://twitter.com/srijonrick/status/1643713147583471616?s=20'>gap year experiences</a>. In the past, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with organizations such as the AI Alignment Awards (formerly The Turing Prize), Emergent Ventures India, Scaler, Effective Thesis, Jane Street, and others on these topics. I've also been mentoring students on article publication and the Spirit of Ramanujan Fellowship, which has been a lot of fun.

#### Interests
I enjoy each of them but engaged in very few at a time.

<ul>
<li>Trekking. Mostly pilgrimages in India such as Kedarnath, Tirupati, and Vaishno Devi, besides a few like the Berkeley Panoramic hill hike.</li>
<li> Films in the form of reflective and introspective storytelling journeys, such as those of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@nataliexlynn'>Natalie Lynn</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@RyanNgFilms'>Ryan Ng</a>, et al. </li>
<li>Hardware and electrical engineering (want to devote more time towards this)</li>
<li>My journaling and writings </li>
<li>Gym and football (soccer) </li>
<li>Drawing, particularly watercolor and pencil shading</li>
</ul>

#### Ideas that intrigue me 

<ul>
  <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFArCKhnbuY&t=5s'>Brain Controlled Machines</a> </li>
  <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@BryanJohnson/about'>Human life extension and longevity through epigenetic age reduction</a> </li>
  <li>Constrained Writing. (Take: Every writing is constrained writing, whether it's college admissions essays that need to be within 250 words or what is described <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnvPY_d0njs'>here</a>. The difference is one might be significantly harder to do.) </li>

</ul>

#### What I care about

Unnecessary suffering of people from preventable diseases such as curable blindness, tuberculosis, infections, and untreated injuries. Which in some cases leads to amputations, especially for villagers and rural people who lack awareness or financial strength for available treatments.
