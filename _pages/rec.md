#### tactics

Some old and classic ones, but I couldn't help but restate how fruitful they are.

<ul>
<details>
  <summary> <strong>Self-studying</strong> </summary>
  It teaches one a lot more than just the syllabus. You get to realize and learn a lot about your learning style and capabilities. Further, I've seen it instilling agency and accountability in me, which later translated into taking responsibility for other important things early on e.g. managing my own finances and forms for international grant transfers. Also, you happen to develop the eagerness to independently delve into any subject, paper, or skill that you wish to learn whenever you like!

<details>
  <summary> <strong>Cold emails</strong> </summary>
  The adage goes, "If you don't ask, it is anyway a NO." Simply reaching out and sending an email or message can lead to opportunities beyond our wildest imaginations that we can’t fathom. I followed <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-emails-got-me-10-minutes-gary-vaynerchuk-zach-dixon/'>this</a> approach and received responses from individuals and organizations that provided unimaginable help with my needs and in achieving my aspirations. So, don't hesitate—just send that message! And positively <a href='https://guzey.com/follow-up/'>follow up</a>.

<details>
  <summary> <strong>Getting/finding great mentors</strong> </summary>
  Having great teachers and seniors can help avoid many pitfalls and make tasks much easier. This can be especially useful when facing complex problems and situations and trying to avoid overthinking. Personally, it took me several years of trial and error before I found my mentors. However, you might be able to find yours by reaching out through your network or mutual connections. Importantly, if you establish a warm rapport with your mentors, they can really incubate you with invaluable guidance and instrumental support.

#### a compilation

On the last day of <a href='https://www.warp.camp/'>WARP23</a>, we all were asked to pick up a task and try to accomplish it. It was called Quest Day! I wanted to empty my bookmark dump from the past 3-4 years, where I had saved tons of pages that I found useful or interesting throughout high school. I completed collating whatever I had there into <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SJkXBbbpzvCPfM7jK_hHfcql9m3eTsmlibzCeNM6YQ/edit?usp=sharing">this</a></b> scholarships and opportunities doc. Please feel free to share further.
